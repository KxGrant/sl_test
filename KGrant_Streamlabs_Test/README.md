#### Questions

- How long did it take you to complete this assignment?
I spent around 6 hours working on this assignment. A small portion of time was spent of problem 1 (around 30 minutes) and the bulk of time was spent on problem 2.    
    
- What about this assignment did you find most challenging?
Keeping it succinct! Especially with problem 2, I could easily spend a week or more digging into the data and looking for interesting relationships. I tried to limit it to a handful of questions and considerations. 

- What about this assignment did you find unclear?
There's some ambiguity in the SQL questions but I noted assumptions as I went and outlined business scenarios that would change the granularity of the query. 

- Do you feel like this assignment was an appropriate level of difficulty?
I enjoyed the assignment and do not feel that it was too difficult.
